## Areas of improvement
- Having a page with previous orders and a quick way to re-order them.
- Search feature which allows to look for a restaurant based on food type (Italian, asian etc.).
- Notification when the food is delivered.

## Acknowledgments
This app was inspired by real delivery applications like UberEats, Grubhub and Doordash.
